## Description
This is my thesis project, in which I try to reconstruct the city of 
Athens (Greece) procedurally. So far, there has been progress
towards the procedural construction of neoclassical type of buildings.
They have just started to resemble actual neoclassical buildings!

## Technical stuff
I use [Unity3D engine](http://unity3d.com/) on Windows 7 OS for the rendering. 
I also use VS2010 as IDE. I don't think there's anything else here ...

## How can I try it out?
These files are actually the contents of the Assets folder of a Unity3D project.
So if you want try it out, start an empty Unity3D project, git clone into the
project's folder and rename the cloned folder to "Assets" or do `git clone git://github.com/tkaretsos/ProceduralBuildings.git Assets`
inside the project folder.
